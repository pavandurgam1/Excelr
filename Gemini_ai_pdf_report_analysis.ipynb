The reference range is 1:20, indicating a higher than normal level, suggesting possible past or present exposure to typhoid.

            "\n",
            "**1. WIDAL Test:** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella typhi* and *Salmonella paratyphi*, bacteria that cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The numbers (e.g., 1:160) represent the dilution of the blood sample at which antibodies were still detected.  A higher number suggests a greater likelihood of infection.  In this case:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:**  Suggests a possible past or present infection with *Salmonella Typhi*.  The \"O\" refers to a specific antigen of the bacteria.\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"H\" 1:80:**  Also suggests a possible past or present infection with *Salmonella Typhi*. The \"H\" refers to a different antigen of the bacteria.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:** Within the normal range, suggesting no recent infection with this *Salmonella* type.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"BH\" 1:20:** Within the normal range, suggesting no recent infection with this *Salmonella* type.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Dengue Serology:** This tests for dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.  The results are all negative, meaning no evidence of a current dengue infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen:** Negative (meaning no dengue virus antigen was detected).\n",
            "* **Dengue IgG:** Negative (meaning no IgG antibodies against dengue were detected. IgG antibodies typically show past infection).\n",
            "* **Dengue IgM:** Negative (meaning no IgM antibodies against dengue were detected. IgM antibodies typically indicate a recent or current infection).\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):** This test measures how quickly red blood cells settle at the bottom of a test tube.  A high ESR can indicate inflammation or infection in the body.  Mr. Goud's ESR is elevated (26 mm/hr in the first hour, 52 mm/hr in the second hour), suggesting the presence of inflammation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Rapid Malaria Test:** This is a quick test to detect malaria parasites in the blood. Both tests (for *Plasmodium vivax* (P.V) and *Plasmodium falciparum* (P.F), the two most common types) were negative, meaning no malaria was detected.\n",
            "\n",
            "**5. Complete Blood Picture (CBC):** This is a comprehensive blood test that provides information about various components of the blood:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Hemoglobin (Hb):**  13.6 g/dL (within the normal range for males). This measures the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.\n",
            "* **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** 4.3 million/cumm (slightly low, but still within the acceptable range). These are responsible for carrying oxygen.\n",
            "* **White Blood Cells (WBC):** 7200 cells/cumm (within the normal range). These fight infection.\n",
            "* **Platelets:** 2.0 lakhs/cumm (within the normal range). These help with blood clotting.\n",
            "* **Packed Cell Volume (PCV):** 40.5% (within the normal range). This indicates the percentage of red blood cells in the blood.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** This breaks down the types of white blood cells. All values are within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Peripheral Blood Smear:** The overall appearance of the blood cells under a microscope was normal.\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. HbA1c:** This test measures the average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months.  Mr. Goud's HbA1c is 5.4%, which is in the normal range for someone without diabetes.\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. Serum Creatinine:** This measures kidney function. Mr. Goud's creatinine level (0.8 mg/dL) is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**8. Random Blood Glucose:** This measures blood sugar at a random time.  Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**9. Liver Function Test (LFT):** These tests assess liver health. All values are within normal limits, except for slight elevation in the ESR result.\n",

            "* **Total Bilirubin:** Measures the amount of bilirubin (a breakdown product of red blood cells) in the blood.\n",

            "* **Indirect Bilirubin:** Another type of bilirubin.\n",
            "* **Alkaline Phosphatase:** An enzyme found in the liver and bones.\n",
            "* **SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT):** Enzymes found in the liver, high levels may indicate liver damage. Both are slightly elevated above the lower limit of normal, but still within the acceptable range.\n",
            "* **Total Protein and Albumin:** Proteins in the blood.\n",
            "* **Globulin:** Another blood protein.\n",
            "* **A/G Ratio:** The ratio of albumin to globulin.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",

            " The provided lab report does not offer a diagnosis.  It only presents test results.  The elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) of 26 mm/hr in the first hour and 52 mm/hr in the second hour suggests *inflammation* somewhere in the body, but that's not a diagnosis itself.  The slightly elevated S. Typhi \"O\" titer (1:160) might indicate past exposure to typhoid fever, but not necessarily current infection.  All other results are within normal ranges or negative for the conditions tested (dengue, malaria).  A doctor needs to interpret these results in conjunction with the patient's symptoms and medical history to make a diagnosis.\n",
